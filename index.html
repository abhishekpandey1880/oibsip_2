        <p>Patel was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat. He was a
            successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda,
            Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of
            the most influential leaders in Gujarat. .<br><br>

            Gandhiji was the architect of our independence and Sardar of our unity. There are not many who might have
            done
            one tenth of what Sardar has achieved.<br><br>

            He performed a miracle in this country both in winning the freedom for his country and also, in the cause of
            unification and consolidation of the country.Sardar Patel certainly supplied an element of strength and
            stability which this country needs very badly today.<br>

                    Nadiad, Gujarat.He was a barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played a
                    leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its integration into a united,
                    independent nation.</p>

                <p>In September 1917, Patel delivered a speech in Borsad, encouraging Indians nationwide to sign
                    Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj – self-rule – from Britain. On Gandhi's encouragement, Patel
                    became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, a public body that would become the Gujarati arm of the
                    Indian National Congress.
